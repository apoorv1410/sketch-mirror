# Realtime Drawing Canvas with socket.io

This project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating canvas and socket.io to enable real-time drawing collaboration.

- Responsive design: The application is optimized for various screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Audio interactivity: Added pencial and eraser sound toggles for enhanced drawing UX
- Share/Copy feature: Added 'navigaator' API support to easily share your art with others
